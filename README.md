<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Clone this specific Github repository to your local device. Downlad the Dataset from kaggle using the link provided below. Open the repository and run the model_definition.py file (Make sure to change the paths given in the code to the path where the dataset is downloaded). A model  named "model.h5" will be created in the same directory where model_definitions.py is located.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>After installing the model, the application can be used in the local server by using Django server. For that, open the terminal and change directory to where the file is located and use the command "python manage.py runserver"</p>
<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
<p>The dataset is downloaded from kaggle.com. Its a vast dataset with over 3000 files, seperated into testing and training sets. In each, there are 4 different folders for "Pituitary Tumor", "Meningioma Tumor", "Glioma Tumor" and finally "No Tumor".</p>

<h2 id="model">Model</h2>
<p>The CNN model is defined using the Sequential API from Keras. It consists of several layers:

<ui> Convolutional layers: These layers extract features from the input images.
<ui> MaxPooling layers: These layers downsample the feature maps.
<ui> Dropout layers: These layers prevent overfitting by randomly dropping a fraction of the connections.
<ui> Flatten layer: This layer flattens the feature maps into a 1-dimensional vector.
<ui> Dense layers: These layers are fully connected and perform classification.
<ui> Output layer: This layer has 4 units (corresponding to the 4 tumor classes) and uses the softmax activation function for <ui> multi-class classification.
</p>
<h2 id="predictions">Predictions</h2>
<p>Explain the <code>predictions.py</code> file and how to use it. Describe its purpose, input requirements, and how to interpret the output or predictions generated by the file. If necessary, include examples or sample code to illustrate its usage.</p>
<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>
<p>Guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project. Include information about how to report issues, propose changes, or submit pull requests. Specify any coding conventions, testing procedures, or other requirements for contributors.</p>
<h2 id="license">License</h2>
<p>Specify the license under which the project is distributed. Provide a brief overview of the license terms and conditions, and include a link to the full license file if applicable.</p>
<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
